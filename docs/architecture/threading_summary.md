# BitNet 12-Core Threading Utilization Summary

## Key Findings

Based on testing, here's how to effectively use your 12 cores with BitNet:

### 1. **Single Inference Performance**
- BitNet's optimized kernels may perform better with **fewer threads** for simple prompts
- Complex/longer prompts benefit from more threads
- Test showed optimal performance at 2 threads for simple tasks

### 2. **Parallel Processing Strategy**

For maximum throughput with multiple prompts, use **parallel processes**:

```bash
# Run 6 parallel instances with 2 threads each
for i in {1..6}; do
    OMP_NUM_THREADS=2 python3 run_inference.py -p "Prompt $i" -n 50 &
done
wait
```

This utilizes all 12 threads (6 × 2) for concurrent processing.

### 3. **Quick Commands**

**Single prompt (auto-optimized):**
```bash
python3 run_inference.py -p "Your prompt" -n 100
```

**Parallel batch processing:**
```bash
python3 parallel_inference.py
# Choose option 3 for quick demo
```

**Monitor thread usage:**
```bash
python3 monitor_threads.py
# Choose option 3 for quick test
```

**Test optimal thread count:**
```bash
python3 thread_demo.py
```

### 4. **Recommended Configurations**

| Use Case | Configuration | Command |
|----------|--------------|---------|
| Single simple prompt | 2-4 threads | `python3 run_inference.py -p "prompt" -t 4` |
| Single complex prompt | 8-12 threads | `python3 run_inference.py -p "prompt" -t 12` |
| Multiple prompts | 6×2 or 3×4 threads | `python3 parallel_inference.py` |
| Real-time server | 4×3 threads | Use threading strategy "balanced" |

### 5. **Performance Tips**

1. **Cache Efficiency**: Fewer threads can mean better cache utilization
2. **Memory Bandwidth**: BitNet is memory-bound, not compute-bound
3. **Parallel > Threads**: Running multiple processes often beats single multi-threaded process
4. **Test Your Workload**: Optimal configuration depends on prompt complexity

### 6. **Example: Maximum Throughput**

To process 12 prompts as fast as possible:

```python
# Save as batch_process.py
import subprocess
import concurrent.futures

prompts = [f"Prompt {i}" for i in range(12)]

def process(prompt):
    cmd = ["python3", "run_inference.py", "-p", prompt, "-n", "50", "-t", "2"]
    subprocess.run(cmd, env={"OMP_NUM_THREADS": "2"})

# Process all prompts in parallel
with concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor(max_workers=6) as executor:
    executor.map(process, prompts)
```

### 7. **Environment Setup**

For consistent performance:

```bash
# Add to ~/.bashrc
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=12
export OMP_PROC_BIND=true
export OMP_PLACES=cores

# Or use the provided script
source bitnet-env.sh
```

## Conclusion

Your 12-core CPU is best utilized by:
- Running **multiple parallel instances** rather than one heavily threaded instance
- Using **2-4 threads per process** for optimal cache usage
- Leveraging the **parallel_inference.py** script for batch processing
- Monitoring performance with **monitor_threads.py** to find optimal settings for your specific use case
