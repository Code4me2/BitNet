# BitNet Directory Cleanup Summary

## Cleanup Results

Successfully cleaned up the BitNet directory, reducing size from **1.6GB to 1.5GB** (saved ~100MB).

### Files Removed

1. **Archive Files (51MB)**
   - `cmake.tar.gz` - Already extracted to cmake-local/

2. **Build Artifacts (64MB)**
   - `build/` directory - All intermediate build files
   - 63 object files (.o) - 12MB
   - 2 static libraries (.a) - 3.1MB

3. **Cache Files (464KB)**
   - Python cache directories (__pycache__)
   - 10 Python bytecode files (.pyc)

4. **Log Files (116KB)**
   - Empty log file: codegen.log
   - Compile logs: compile.log, generate_build_files.log, install_gguf.log

### Files Preserved

- ✅ Model files (ggml-model-i2_s.gguf)
- ✅ All source code and scripts
- ✅ Configuration files
- ✅ Documentation
- ✅ cmake-local directory (required - no system cmake)
- ✅ .git directory (version control - optional, 82MB)

## Post-Cleanup Actions

1. **Rebuild Required**: After cleanup, the binary needed to be rebuilt:
   ```bash
   ./rebuild_bitnet.sh
   ```

2. **Verification**: Model tested and working correctly with optimized performance.

## Cleanup Tools Created

### 1. `cleanup_bitnet.sh`
Interactive cleanup script with safety features:
- Prompts for confirmation before removing items
- Shows file sizes before deletion
- Preserves essential files
- Auto-yes mode available with `-y` flag

### 2. `analyze_cleanup.sh`
Analysis tool that shows what would be cleaned without removing anything.

### 3. `rebuild_bitnet.sh`
Quick rebuild script that uses local cmake to restore binaries after cleanup.

## Recommendations

1. **Regular Cleanup**: Run cleanup after major updates or builds
2. **Before Cleanup**: Always run `analyze_cleanup.sh` first
3. **After Cleanup**: Use `rebuild_bitnet.sh` to restore binaries
4. **Git History**: The .git directory (82MB) can be removed if version control isn't needed

## Final State

The BitNet directory is now clean and optimized with:
- All necessary files for inference preserved
- Unnecessary build artifacts removed
- Model performance verified at 16-28 tokens/sec
- Easy-to-use cleanup and rebuild tools available
