# Docker Status for BitNet Inference

## Current Status: Non-Functional ‚ùå

The Docker build for BitNet inference is currently not working. This document explains why and provides alternatives.

## Why Docker Doesn't Work

### 1. Architecture-Specific Compilation
BitNet.cpp generates optimized code specifically for your CPU during the build process:
- Custom kernels are generated based on CPU features (AVX2, AVX512, etc.)
- Thread configurations are optimized for the specific core count
- Memory access patterns are tuned for the cache hierarchy

**Result**: A Docker image built on one CPU won't work on a different CPU model.

### 2. Build Process Complexity
The `setup_env.py` script performs multiple complex steps:
```
1. Downloads model from HuggingFace
2. Detects CPU architecture and features
3. Generates custom C++ kernel code
4. Compiles with architecture-specific optimizations
5. Creates quantized model versions
```

This process is not easily portable across different environments.

### 3. File Path Dependencies
The build creates hardcoded paths and expects specific directory structures that don't translate well to containerized environments.

## What Happens When You Try

If you attempt `docker-compose up`:
1. The build might succeed on your machine
2. The container will likely fail to start with errors like:
   - "Model file not found" (path mismatch)
   - "Illegal instruction" (CPU mismatch)
   - "Symbol not found" (missing architecture-specific code)

## Alternatives

### Option 1: Local Build (Recommended)
```bash
cd bitnet-inference/BitNet
python3 setup_env.py -md models/BitNet-b1.58-2B-4T -q i2_s
./build/bin/llama-server -m models/BitNet-b1.58-2B-4T/ggml-model-i2_s.gguf \
  --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8081
```

### Option 2: Runtime-Only Container
If you need containerization, build locally first, then create a minimal runtime container:

```dockerfile
# runtime-only.dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:22.04

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    libgomp1 \
    libstdc++6 \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Copy your locally-built files
COPY BitNet/build/bin/llama-server /usr/local/bin/
COPY BitNet/models /models

EXPOSE 8081

CMD ["llama-server", "-m", "/models/BitNet-b1.58-2B-4T/ggml-model-i2_s.gguf", \
     "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8081"]
```

Build and run:
```bash
# First build BitNet locally
cd BitNet && python3 setup_env.py -md models/BitNet-b1.58-2B-4T -q i2_s
cd ..

# Then build runtime container
docker build -f runtime-only.dockerfile -t bitnet-runtime .
docker run -p 8081:8081 bitnet-runtime
```

### Option 3: Cloud-Specific Images
For cloud deployment, build architecture-specific images:
- Build on same CPU architecture as deployment target
- Create separate images for Intel, AMD, ARM
- Tag images with architecture: `bitnet:intel-avx2`, `bitnet:amd-zen3`, etc.

## Future Possibilities

The BitNet team would need to implement:
1. Pre-built binaries for common architectures
2. Runtime CPU detection with dynamic kernel loading
3. WebAssembly or other portable compilation targets

Until then, Docker support remains limited.

## Workarounds for Development

### Using Docker for Dependencies Only
You can use Docker for the development environment while running BitNet on the host:

```yaml
# docker-compose.dev.yml
version: '3.8'
services:
  dev-env:
    image: ubuntu:22.04
    volumes:
      - .:/workspace
    command: |
      bash -c "
      apt-get update && apt-get install -y build-essential cmake python3 python3-pip
      cd /workspace/BitNet
      python3 setup_env.py -md models/BitNet-b1.58-2B-4T -q i2_s
      "
```

This builds BitNet inside a container but you still run it on the host.

## Summary

- **Don't use**: The current Dockerfile for production
- **Do use**: Local builds for optimal performance
- **Consider**: Runtime-only containers if you must containerize
- **Remember**: BitNet is optimized for bare-metal performance

The lack of Docker support is a limitation of BitNet's architecture-specific optimization approach, which is also what makes it fast.
